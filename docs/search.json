    "section": "",
    "text": "Preface\nFrom 2007 to 2011 I carried out original research into the community genetics of aspen (Populus tremula) in various parts of Scotland. It has been my intention to open this thesis up to the wider world by publishing in an accessible format so that others may make use of the information.\nThe thesis is available as a PDF document via the University of Edinburgh digital research archive here: Edinburgh Research Archive\nMy professional background in in horticulture, attending Broomfield College in Derbyshire for a National Diploma in Horticulture, after which I worked at the Jerusalem Botanical Garden in Israel and in private estate gardens.\nI then gained a Higher National Diploma in Horticulture with Plantsmanship from the Scottish Agricultural College (now SRUC) and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh - a fantastic experience learning from incredibly knowledgeable and experienced horticulturists and botanists. Having discovered that I really enjoyed the botanical and taxonomic aspects of horticulture, I gained a BSc (Hons) Botany from Reading University, and spent my dissertation summer measuring Carpobrotus spp. on the Bournemouth-Southbourne coast (which may be another Bookdown project!).\nAfter working very hard, I was accepted onto the MSc Biodiversity and Taxonomy of Plants with the University of Edinburgh and Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (graciously funded by NERC), and spent the following year continuing my thesis research into the phylogenetics of Prunus laurocerasus and its allies from Europe and Central Asia.\nI started my PhD (funded by BBSRC) and the topic of this book in 2007 - a joint supervisory effort between the University of Edinburgh (Dr Richard Ennos), the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (Dr Chris Ellis), and the James Hutton Institute (Dr Glenn Iason). I was fortunate to have such an excellent team of supervisors. Special mention to Dr Richard Milne (University of Edinburgh) who took on the role of ‘pastoral supervisor’ and provided many hours of light relief with Scrabble games and tea.\nThe content presented here is a distilled version of the thesis that exists in the archive, with some additional analyses from biomass samples that have been air-drying for at least 10 years as I did not have time to work on them during my PhD.\nEven though it has been many years since I did this work, I still have a profound love for aspen and their epiphyte communities. I was privileged to have been given this opportunity, and spent considerable time out in the field collecting data, samples, and identifying the lichen flora of different aspen clones and communities. To this day I feel a deep connection to the land I walked on and the woodlands I worked in. It was a real labour of love, despite the blood (from climbing too many fences), sweat and copious tears.\nNow the official bit:\n\nThesis submitted for the examination of:\nDoctor of Philosophy\nInstitute of Evolutionary Biology\nSchool of Biological Sciences\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n&\nRoyal Botanic Garden Edinburgh\n&\nThe James Hutton Institute, Aberdeen\n\nDeclaration:\nI hereby declare that the work contained in this thesis is my own, unless otherwise acknowledged and cited. This thesis has not in whole or part been previously presented for any degree.\nChantel Davies\nEdinburgh\nAugust 26, 2011"

    "text": "One such foundation species is aspen (Populus tremula L.), which in Scotland exists in fragmented clonal patches. Aspen has important conservation value because it is associated with a high diversity of rare organisms, many of which have UK Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs). One such group are the epiphytic cryptogams (i.e. mosses, liverworts, lichens). To date more than 300 species have been recorded on aspen in Scotland, representing approximately 40% of the epiphyte flora of Europe. The research presented here uses a combination of a natural aspen system and two aspen ‘common garden’ trials to test whether genetic diversity in aspen affects the composition of dependent epiphytic communities. In addition it investigates whether variation in two phenotypic traits of aspen, bark texture and bark phenolic chemistry, can account for the variation in epiphyte communities present on different aspen clones.\nIn the wild population of aspen, the proportion of smooth bark and the concentration of a number of bark phenolic compounds were found to vary significantly between clones, and variation was under strong genetic control. Epiphyte community composition also varied among aspen clones and was significantly affected by the proportion of smooth bark possessed by clones. In the common garden experiment epiphyte community composition was again affected by genetic differences between clones, but the pattern could not be related to variation in either bark type or bark phenolic chemistry. The results indicate that epiphyte communities are part of the ‘extended phenotype’ of native aspen populations in Scotland. A diversity of aspen genotypes in the landscape is essential for maintaining and possibly enhancing current levels of epiphyte diversity with benefits for ecosystem health as a whole."

    "section": "Ecological effects of interactions at the species level",
    "text": "Ecological effects of interactions at the species level\nEcology is concerned with understanding the distribution and abundance of living organisms, and focuses on the interactions that occur among organisms, and between organisms and their physical environment. A recurring theme in ecology is that the patterns of species distributions and abundances are shaped not only by edaphic and environmental factors, but also by interactions with other organisms. How one species interacts jointly with the environment and with another species has profound extended consequences for the composition of communities and potentially ecosystems (Whitham et al. 2003). A well-researched illustration of this can be found in the predator-prey relationship between bears (Ursus spp.) and salmon (Onchorynchus spp.). Salmon is a particularly important food source for brown bears (Ursus arctos), being positively correlated with female body mass, breeding capability, litter size and population density (Hilderbrand et al. 1999). During spawning season, salmon return from oceanic environments to the rivers they originally spawned from to continue their life cycle. Much of the energy obtained from the ocean is retained within migrating salmon populations and returned to the rivers they spawned from. There is a dramatic increase in body fat (up to 85% increase) and protein (up to 40% increase) from the moment salmon arrive at their destination to senescence several weeks later (Gende et al. 2004). Bears populating these rivers in order to feed have been found to select for larger, male salmon, thus potentially reducing the average body size of salmon that survive long enough to breed. Smaller salmon are generally less fecund, and in the case of no or partial spawning, there is a consequence of reduced paternity for offspring, potentially reducing genetic diversity (Reimchen 2000; Quinn and Buck 2001). This energy is either consumed by bear populations near the site with the remains decomposing into the water system, or used for spawning before death occurs.\nThe commonest way of exploring interactions among organisms and their effects on communities and ecosystems is to focus on interactions that occur between pairs of species. These interactions may involve competition, mutualism, herbivory, parasitism, mutualism or synergistic interactions and can occur between organisms at the same or different trophic levels. It has been recognised that individuals within species are not uniform, but differ genetically from one another. Genetic variation among individuals within a species can affect phenotypic traits that may be important in determining their interactions with other organisms. For instance genetic variation in secondary chemistry of plants influences their interaction with herbivores with important ecological consequences. A good example of this is provided by recent studies of the effects of monoterpenes in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and a range of herbivores, such as slugs (Arion ater), capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) (Iason et al. 2011). Grazing experiments were carried out on each herbivore type using a range of Scots pine trees that had been verified as having variable monoterpene concentration (high, medium, or low). Of the thirteen monoterpenes selected to test herbivore response, \\(\\alpha\\)-pinene, the most abundant monoterpene in Scots pine and with strong genetic correlation to other monoterpenes, successfully deterred slugs and capercaillie. By avoiding those pines with higher concentrations of \\(\\alpha\\)-pinene, slugs and capercaillie are selecting for higher abundance of a specific monoterpene.\nThe outcome of interactions is often to change the genetic composition of one species as a consequence of natural selection. Ultimately this may affect the population size of that species e.g. adaptation of pests to pesticides first brings about resistance evolution in the pest population, then an increase in the pest population as resistant individuals rise in frequency in the population. A well-known example of this is the case of myxomatosis-resistance in wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations in Europe and Australia (Ross and Sanders 1977, 1984; Aparicio, Solari, and Bonino 2004). Originally introduced in the 1950s in Great Britain to control high numbers of wild rabbits, the myxoma virus was incredibly effective in killing an estimated 99% of the total rabbit population that were exposed. By the 1970s increasing resistance had been recorded in some wild British populations (Ross and Sanders 1984), with a greater level of resistance recorded at least a decade earlier in Australian populations (Aparicio, Solari, and Bonino 2004). Several strains of the original virus have evolved, but so too has rabbit resistance to the virus, demonstrating a host-parasite co-evolutionary process. This evolution of host resistance explained a rise in rabbit population sizes in both areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAparicio, J P, H G Solari, and N Bonino. 2004. “Competition and Coexistence in Host-Parasite Systems: The Myxomatosis Case.” Population Ecology 46 (1). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10144-004-0173-0.\n\n\nGende, S M, T P Quinn, R Hilborn, A P Hendry, and B Dickerson. 2004. “Brown Bears Selectively Kill Salmon with Higher Energy Content but Only in Habitats That Facilitate Choice.” Oikos (Copenhagen, Denmark) 104 (3): 518–28. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12762.x.\n\n\nHilderbrand, G V, C C Schwartz, C T Robbins, M E Jacoby, T A Hanley, S M Arthur, and C Servheen. 1999. “The Importance of Meat, Particularly Salmon, to Body Size, Population Productivity, and Conservation of North American Brown Bears.” Canadian Journal of Zoology 77 (1): 132–38. https://doi.org/10.1139/z98-195.\n\n\nIason, G R, J M O’Reilly-Wapstra, M J Brewer, R W Summers, and B D Moore. 2011. “Do Multiple Herbivores Maintain Chemical Diversity of Scots Pine Monoterpenes?” Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 366 (1569): 1337–45. https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2010.0236.\n\n\nQuinn, T P, and G B Buck. 2001. “Size- and Sex-Selective Mortality of Adult Sockeye Salmon: Bears, Gulls, and Fish Out of Water,” 11.\n\n\nReimchen, T E. 2000. “Some Ecological and Evolutionary Aspects of Bear Interactions in Coastal British Columbia” 78: 10.\n\n\nRoss, J, and M F Sanders. 1977. “Innate Resistance to Myxomatosis in Wild Rabbits in England.” Journal of Hygiene 79 (3): 411–16. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022172400053262.\n\n\n———. 1984. “The Development of Genetic Resistance to Myxomatosis in Wild Rabbits in Britain.” Journal of Hygiene 92 (3): 255–61. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022172400064494.\n\n\nWhitham, T G, W P Young, G D Martinsen, C A Gehring, J A Schweitzer, S M Shuster, G M Wimp, et al. 2003. “Community and Ecosystem Genetics: A Consequence of the Extended Phenotype.” Ecology 84 (3): 559–73. https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0559:CAEGAC]2.0.CO;2."

    "text": "Another situation where genetic variation within a species has the potential to affect the distribution and abundance of associated organisms is where that species plays the role of a foundation species in the community. Foundation species are those that are perceived to provide important structure to a community and usually represent the species with the greatest abundance or biomass in the community (Bruno, Stachowicz, and Bertness 2003). They may constitute a major food source, such as kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) in ocean environments, possessing physical traits that regulate ecosystem processes and provide a habitat for associated, dependent, communities (Graham 2004). Kelp forests have a long-standing reputation for providing one of the largest and most important foundation habitats on the planet (Mann 1973; Steneck et al. 2002), with high diversity of associated species - more than 200 species in southern California alone (North 1971; Foster and Schiel 1988). An important consequence of this relationship is that genetic variation in a foundation species could potentially have a large influence on the community of organisms with which it interacts. For instance if the foundation species provides the habitat for a community of dependent organisms, changes in the physical attributes of the foundation species may modify the habitat of the dependent species, and this may alter the community of dependent species that can be supported.\nThis effect has been demonstrated in common garden experiments involving the flowering plant, goldenrod (Solidago altissima). Here genetic variation between goldenrod genotypes led to variation among their associated arthropod communities (Maddox and Root 1990). Using the same foundation plant species, high genetic diversity was revealed in the phenotypic traits of flowering time and floral abundance, as well as in the extended phenotype traits of flower visitor abundance and richness (Genung et al. 2010). These studies demonstrate the importance of genetic variation in dominant species, and their potential influence for structuring communities of dependent organisms. In the case of pollinators, increased insect diversity in a natural habitat where Solidago is abundant could positively influence pollination for other plant species and promote genetic diversity within the community.\nThe phenotype of an organism is its outward appearance and is determined by an interaction between its genotype and the environment. For instance aspects of a tree’s phenotype would normally be characters such as the shape of its leaves, the morphology of its bark and so on. However if we are dealing with foundation species, and if the genotype of the foundation species influences the community of dependent organisms then the dependent community could be considered as part of the phenotype of the foundation species, or its ‘extended phenotype’. For instance if genetic variation affecting leaf shape/chemistry in a tree alters the realised niche for associated insects with community consequences, then the variable insect community found on a tree could be thought of as an aspect of the extended phenotype of that tree. The term ‘extended phenotype’ was first coined by Richard Dawkins (Dawkins 1982) to describe the effects of an organism’s genetic constitution on its community of associated organisms."

    "text": "2.1 Validating and testing the extended phenotype concept\nMany studies have been conducted to explore and test the validity of the extended phenotype concept and to assess the importance of genetic variation in foundation species on their communities of dependent organisms. Studies have typically used plants as the foundation species, and insects as the dependent species to investigate the importance of plant genotype and environmental factors at differing spatial scales. In a study by Johnson and Agrawal (2005), fourteen genotypes of Oenothera biennis (total of 926 plants) were planted into five natural habitats representative of the environments in which this plant occurs. Plant genotypic differences accounted for as much as 41% of the variation in arthropod diversity, evenness, richness, abundance and biomass on individual plants, and explained more arthropod community variation than environmental variation across spatial scales. Arthropods appeared to select for certain traits of O. biennis, which may lead to important evolutionary changes in associated insect communities should the plants undergo significant genetic change. Furthermore, (Bangert et al. 2006) demonstrated how genetic variation in hybridizing cottonwood (Populus spp.) affects the structure of an associated arthropod community. One important plant trait tested as a possible intermediate link between plant genetics and arthropod community structure was chemical composition of the leaves. In both a common garden experiment of 29 different genotypes (F\\(_1\\) hybrids and backcrosses) and 25 of the same genotypes within wild populations, trees with similar genetic compositions had similar chemical compositions and similar arthropod compositions.\nThe potential genetic effects on the relative thickness of living bark and characteristics of decorticating bark in common garden experiments of Eucalyptus globulus were studied by Barbour et al. (2009): twenty trees from each of five provenances were selected at random from a common garden trial established in northern Tasmania. Trees were sampled at 17 years old, and 25m in height. Of the ten bark traits measured, significant variation was found in eight of the traits and attributed to genetic differences among provenances (ranging from p <0.001-0.02). Overall, decorticating bark decreased with trunk height. Sampling macro-arthropod communities living within the bark revealed a significant effect of host tree genotype on species richness and abundance, with 60% of the overall variation in community attributable to differences in bark structure associated with Eucalyptus provenance.\nHowever, contradictory results were found by Tack et al. (2010), who showed how genetic effects of a host plant on associated insect communities tend to be diluted at increasing spatial scales. Herbivorous insects on oak (Quercus robur) were sampled in a common garden experiment replicated at three spatial scales: landscape scale (~5 km\\(^2\\)); regional scale (~10,000 km\\(^2\\)); and wild trees at various spatial scales. Their sampling revealed that 32% of the species richness at the landscape scale was explained by spatial correlations, with this effect increasing at the regional and greater scales. Host plant genotype was considered to be of secondary importance.\nGenetic effects have been researched in forest systems where trees are foundation species and associated insects in particular are dependent species. For example, the resistance or susceptibility of Pinus spp. (foundation) to grazing by gypsy moth can significantly influence the distribution of nearly 1000 dependent organisms, including birds, mammals, invertebrates and fungi (Brown et al. 2001; Whitham et al. 2003; Kuske et al. 2003; Diner et al. 2009).\nForest trees are particularly important as foundation species because they provide habitats for many different types of organisms; intra-specific variation can also influence associated communities of plants and arthropods (Zytynska et al. 2011). Genetic effects of Populus spp. have been found for important ecological processes. A comparison of genetic effects on local environments has been carried out using both a model Populus system in a common garden (Schweitzer et al. 2008) and a natural stand (Madritch, Greene, and Lindroth 2009), to evaluate effects of plant genotype on soil processes, such as soil nutrients (i.e., nitrogen) and microbial biomass. In both cases, plant genotype explained variation in soil nitrogen, and microbial activity. In the common garden experiment, genotype explained up to 78% of the variation in microbial biomass. In the natural system, Madritch, Greene, and Lindroth (2009) used 24 distinct Populus tremuloides clones (multiple ramets per clone) spanning a distance of 25km\\(^2\\) to demonstrate the effects of plant genetic identity on soil processes. Sampling leaf chemistry, soil nutrient content and microbial activity beneath each clone revealed significant variation between genotypes for each measured variable. Genetic distance between clones was correlated with differences in ecosystem processes, suggesting that aspen are capable of modifying their local environment and thereby regulate ecosystem functions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBangert, R K, G J Allan, R J Turek, G M Wimp, N Meneses, G D Martinsen, P Keim, and T G Whitham. 2006. “From Genes to Geography: A Genetic Similarity Rule for Arthropod Community Structure at Multiple Geographic Scales: Local to Regional Genetic Correlates of Community Structure.” Molecular Ecology 15 (13): 4215–28. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03092.x.\n\n\nBarbour, R C, J M O’Reilly-Wapstra, D W De Little, G J Jordan, D A Steane, J R Humphreys, J K Bailey, T G Whitham, and B M Potts. 2009. “A Geographic Mosaic of Genetic Variation Within a Foundation Tree Species and Its Community-Level Consequences.” Ecology 90 (7): 1762–72. https://doi.org/10.1890/08-0951.1.\n\n\nBrown, J H, T G Whitham, S K Morgan Ernest, and C A Gehring. 2001. “Complex Species Interactions and the Dynamics of Ecological Systems: Long-Term Experiments.” Science (New York, N.Y.) 293 (5530): 643–50. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.293.5530.643.\n\n\nBruno, J F, J J Stachowicz, and M D Bertness. 2003. “Inclusion of Facilitation into Ecological Theory.” Trends in Ecology & Evolution 18 (3): 119–25. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-5347(02)00045-9.\n\n\nDawkins, R. 1982.

    "text": "An ideal system for achieving this objective comprises the foundation tree, aspen (Populus tremula), and its dependent community of epiphytic lichens and bryophytes. Aspen is a particularly suitable foundation species to study because it is known to show extensive genetic variation within Scotland (Easton 1998). It also has the important attribute of reproducing clonally from suckers. Thus, there are replicate stems possessing the same genotype within a population. This makes it possible to test the significance of differences in phenotypic traits and dependent communities among genotypes within natural populations, using multiple stems per genotype to demonstrate genetic variation. Associated with aspen as dependent species is a particularly rich and important lichen and bryophyte flora with conservation interest (Ellis and Coppins 2006). More than 300 lichen species have been recorded on Scottish aspen (B. J. Coppins & C. J. Ellis, unpublished data). Of these species, twenty-one are Nationally Scarce (recorded in only 16-100 10km squares); twelve are Nationally Rare (recorded in only 15 or fewer 10km squares); three species are listed on Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 19811; five species are Red Data Book listed (Vulnerable); two species are Red Data Book listed (Critically Endangered) (Street & Street in Cosgrove and Amphlett 2001). One species, the aspen specialist Lecanora populicola, was Red Data Book listed (Extinct) until circa 2003 when it was discovered in abundance on aspen in Strathspey (Ellis, pers. comm.). Aspen in Scotland is an important habitat for epiphytic bryophytes (Rothero, G in Cosgrove and Amphlett 2001). Approximately five species of liverwort and twenty-nine species of moss have been recorded on aspen in Scotland. Most noteworthy are those belonging to the genus Orthotrichum. This genus comprises a group of nationally scarce ‘pin-cushion’ mosses that can grow in ‘tufts’ longitudinally on tree trunks. Aspen has been found to host several species of this genus, most notably O. gymnostomum. The related species, O. obtusifolium is Schedule 8 listed and found on several natural aspen stands in the Strathspey area. Furthermore, aspen in Strathspey are the ‘centre of distribution for the nationally rare Orthotrichum speciosum’.\nAspen is a foundation species for lichens and bryophytes because it provides the habitat where these epiphytes grow. Specific physical traits of aspen that will influence the habitat relevant to epiphytes are bark texture and bark secondary chemistry. The latter trait is known to have defensive properties and there exists potential for interaction between bark chemistry and epiphytic community structure. In this thesis the objective will be to explore the aspen/epiphyte system to establish:"

    "text": "4.1 Aspen biology, distribution and ecology\nPopulus tremula L. is a native deciduous tree in the Salicaceae family, with a distribution across Europe (including Britain), North Africa, through temperate Asia and Japan (Brickell, 1999; MacKenzie, 2010). In Scotland, aspen is found in the small areas of the northeastern Highlands (Strathspey). The BSBI hectad distribution map for aspen shows it as being widespread (Figure fig-bsbimap); in reality it is only locally abundant at certain sites, with large populations in Strathspey being unusual in Britain (C. Ellis, pers. comm.).\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: BSBI hectad map of aspen (Populus tremula), showing the UK distribution; each point represents a population, which can vary from a single ramet to many ramets (from http://www.bsbi.org). Approximate location of Strathspey is circled in red.\n\n\nAspen trees can reach heights of up to 24m (Clapham, Tutin, and Warburg 1968; Stace 1997), with pale, greenish-grey bark appearing very smooth on young trees with dark grey diamond-shaped lenticels, becoming dark grey and fissured on older trees. Suckering is common in this species, though may vary depending on the clone. Bark is photosynthetic, sometimes with a whitish or grey bloom of periderm cells in a constant state of being sloughed off (Covington 1975), as illustrated in Figure fig-aspen-bark.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Aspen with green, photosynthetic bark (right) and slightly thicker, greyish bark, colonized by a few crustose lichens and beginning to show signs of cracking around the lenticels. Photo credit: C Davies\n\n\nBuds are generally glabrous, sometimes with a sticky residue. Leaves of mature shoots are 2.5-6cm, orbicular and generally rounded at the base with serrated edges. Initially leaves are pubescent but becoming glabrous with age; petioles are flattened, giving rise to the characteristic fluttering of the leaves in wind. Leaves of suckering shoots can be up to 15cm, ovate to cordate with greyish pubescence on the underside. The flowers are wind-pollinated catkins produced in early spring before the new leaves appear; they are dioecious, with male and female catkins on different trees. The male catkins are patterned green and brown, 5–10 cm long when shedding pollen; the female catkins are green, 2-4 cm long at pollination, maturing in early summer to bear 10–20 capsules each containing numerous tiny seeds embedded in downy fluff. The fluff assists wind dispersal of the seeds when the capsules split open at maturity. Aspen usually flowers from February to March, and is dioecious having male and female flowers on separate trees. Flowering events are rare in locations where summers are cool, but not unknown, therefore trees may have adapted to reproduce vegetatively by suckers. Examples of mature aspen and aspen suckers are shown in Figure fig-aspen-habitat, a-c.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: a - Mature aspen at Invertromie. Younger aspen are to the left of the picture, displaying greyish-white bark; b - Young aspen suckers at Invertromie, maybe 3-4 years old; c - Aspen sucker with a Large Red Damselfly (Pyrrhosoma nymphula). Photo credit: C Davies\n\n\nA clonal patch is referred to as a ‘genet’, with each individual stem known as a ‘ramet’. Ramets of suckering Populus spp. are initially dependent upon the main rootstock for translocation of all nutrients, solutes and hormones, but will eventually become independent and form their own rootstocks (Barnes 1966). Within a genet many suckers may be generated, but not all will survive, and as they die off their roots can decay leaving surviving suckers with root systems largely or entirely independent of the root system it originated from; independence varies across genotypes, but can occur as early as 8 years from initial development (Shepperd 1993), up to 25 years (Barnes 1966). Evidence for whether ramets remain interconnected or not varies significantly, and may be dependent on disturbance from fire and burrowing/ grazing mammals damaging the root connections (Cottam 1954; De Byle 1964; DesRochers and Lieffers 2001). The average lifespan of a ramet is estimated to be less than 80 years (Bean 1976), though ages of up to 150 years have been suggested for populations in the Highlands of Scotland (Macgowan 1997). Pollen records indicate that aspen has been present in the UK since ca. 9000 years BP, though it is unknown whether the current populations arrived here after the end of the last glacial period, or if they are relicts of a pre-ice age community (Mackenzie 2010). Aspen is tolerant of a wide range of soils and environmental conditions (Brickell and Royal Horticultural Society (Great Britain) 1999), and has many uses in horticulture (i.e., shelterbelts: Bean 1976), and forestry (pulp, timber, biofuel: Johansson 2002).\nDespite being fragmented and poorly represented in woodlands, aspen has been recognised as being of high conservation value, due to the high diversity of associated species, including epiphytic lichens and bryophytes. Thirty-nine insect species have been recorded on aspen, including 14 Red Data Book species, three of which are Category 1 (endangered) (Rotheray, G in Cosgrove and Amphlett 2001) . The rare aspen hoverfly (Hammerschmidtia ferruginea) is a UK Biodversity Action Plan (BAP) Priority species, and has been recorded in abundance on rotting aspen logs (Rotheray, G in Parrott and MacKenzie 2009). Up to 43 Lepidopteran species have been recorded on aspen in Scotland, 17 of which are aspen-specialists (Prescott & Stubbs in Parrott and MacKenzie 2009). The larvae of one rare species in particular, the Dark-bordered Beauty moth (Epione vespertaria), feeds exclusively on the young leaves of suckering aspen and therefore its survival is intimately linked with the presence of aspen in the landscape.\n\n4.1.1 Variation within aspen\nDue to its reproductive strategy, many Populus spp., including Scottish aspen (Populus tremula), develop into clonal patches of various sizes. Clones correspond to different genotypes that vary for a range of physical and physiological traits, such as phenology (Yu, Tigerstedt, and Haapanen 2001), nutrient storage (Yu, Tigerstedt, and Haapanen 2001; R. L. Lindroth et al. 2002; Donaldson et al. 2006; Osier and Lindroth 2006), chemical defences (Richard L. Lindroth and Hwang 1996; Orians, Roche, and Fritz 1996; Osier and Lindroth 2001, 2004, 2006; R. L. Lindroth et al. 2002; Donaldson et al. 2006; Donaldson and Lindroth 2007), biomass production (Rytter and Stener 2003; Christersson 2006) and leaf litter decomposition (Madritch, Donaldson, and Lindroth 2006).\n\n\n\n\n\nBarnes, B V. 1966. “The Clonal Growth Habit of American Aspens.” Ecology 47 (3): 439–47. https://doi.org/10.2307/1932983.\n\n\nBean, W J. 1976.

The symbiosis brings about some unique physiological and morphological characteristics. Lacking a complex root system, waxy cuticle and stomata, lichens absorb nutrients through deposition from the atmosphere or from its substrate (Williams et al. 1996; Gilbert 2000). Three main growth forms exist: crustose, foliose and fruticose (Figure fig-lichen-types). Crustose lichens are made up of layers of cortex (fungus), algae/cyanobacteria (beneath the surface of the cortex) and medullary hyphae (fungus), which attach to the substrate; foliose lichens are made up of upper and lower layers of cortex (fungus), algae/cyanobacteria (beneath the surface of the upper cortex) and medullary hyphae (fungus), which may attach to the substrate; fruticose lichens are made up of a central core that attaches to the substrate, around which grows a lower medullary hyphae layer (fungus), a layer of algae or cyanobacteria, and an outer cortex (fungus).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: (Top left) Diagram of crustose lichen structure (left), showing the layers of cortex (fungus), algae/ cyanobacteria and medullary hyphae (fungus), which attach to the substrate.

    "text": "5.2 Moss and liverwort epiphytes\nMosses possess distinct stems and spirally arranged leaf scales, similar to vascular plants. In the stems are three distinct layers: epidermis (outer layer), cortex (middle layer), and the central cylinder. The epidermis tends to be mostly one cell thick, but can have more layers. Young cortical cells and the leaves contain chlorophyll, but this diminishes with age. Mosses attach to their substrate via rhizoids – multicellular filaments growing from the base of the stem. Mosses are generally desiccation-tolerant, being able to survive for long periods of time without water, but rapidly rejuvenating when moisture is present (Scott and Brooks 1943).\nLiverworts consist of parenchyma cells with chlorophyll granules occurring in the superficial cells. A unique feature of liverworts is the presence of terpenoids contained within single membrane-bound bodies. There is a distinct upper and lower surface to the thallus, with the lower surface containing numerous unicellular rhizoids. The epidermis contains a thin cuticle, some of which are thickened with cellulose. Branching tends to be dichotomous, giving rise to the characteristic bilateral branching seen in many liverworts. Unlike mosses, liverworts are more sensitive to desiccation, though some species, such as Frullania, contain a small sac that retains water and enables them to survive in drier conditions (Scott and Brooks 1943)."

    "text": "5.3 Factors influencing epiphyte distribution and abundance\nDistribution and abundance of epiphytes on trees differs with aspect, age of stand, phorophyte1 2 chemical processes, and phorophyte structure (Gustafsson and Eriksson 1995; Hemming and Lindroth 1999; Hedenås, Blomberg, and Ericson 2007; Koopmann 2005; Mistry and Berardi 2005). Epiphyte community diversity on Populus spp. is demonstrably higher than other boreal tree species and its presence in woodlands can positively influence species richness (Uliczka and Angelstam 1999; Goward and Arsenault 2000; Boudreault et al. 2008; Hedenås and Ericson 2000; Juriado, Paal, and Liira 2003; Lõhmus, Rosenvald, and Lõhmus 2006). Cyanolichens (lichens with a cyanobacterium as the primary photosynthetic component) grow more abundantly in young- to middle-aged conifer (Picea and Pseudotsuga) stands when Populus is also present, particularly on trees neighbouring Populus (Goward and Arsenault 2000). Only those trees growing within the drip zone display these differences, which implies an effect of Populus on neighbouring tree species.\nAt broader spatial scales, air quality is one of the most significant factors influencing epiphyte diversity and its effects are well documented (Gilbert 2000). Lichens especially are useful as bioindicators of pollution, with sensitive species often decreasing in abundance in areas where nitrogen and sulphur dioxide in particular are at high levels (Hawksworth and Rose 1970; Ferry, Hawksworth, and Baddeley 1973; Hedenås and Ericson 2000; Hauck et al. 2003; van Herk, Mathijssen-Spiekman, and de Zwart 2003; Werth et al. 2006; Mikhailova 2007).\nWhen investigating the combined effects of climate change, pollution and woodland quality on epiphyte species composition and richness across 324 sites in Scotland, Ellis and Coppins (2010) found a weaker effect of pollution (i.e., sulphur dioxide, acid deposition, nitrogen deposition, ammonia, nitrogen oxides, and ozone), potentially explaining 3.5-3.7% of the measured composition and richness; with climate accounting for 6.7-8.4%. Thus, pollution may not be a particularly dominant force in influencing composition and richness due to the relatively clean air in northern Scotland, away from urban centres (Gilbert 2000). In a comprehensive study on the effects of climate and autogenic succession in epiphyte communities on Populus tremula populations in Scotland, Ellis and Coppins (2006) demonstrated a significant climatic effect. Rainfall was found to be very important, which in Scotland follows a gradient from the wet, oceanic Atlantic west coast to the drier northeast. However, average tree age at each site was also important, with older trees from drier sites having similar community structure to younger trees at wetter sites. Ultimately, older trees and those in wetter areas tended to have a greater frequency of bryophytes and cyanobacterial lichens, with younger trees and those in drier climates having a greater frequency of crustose and green-algal lichens. Sexual crustose lichens tended to be the earliest colonizers of aspen trunks, gradually being overgrown by larger foliose and fruticose species, along with mosses and liverworts (Ellis, C in Parrott and MacKenzie 2009).\nMore locally, epiphytic mosses and lichens exhibit differences in their preference for light, with certain species possessing the ability to acclimatise rapidly to extreme variations whilst others may fail to thrive (Kershaw and Macfarlane 1980; Kershaw 1985). Light quality can also affect lichen diversity on different types of tree bark (Loppi and Frati 2004). The most significant factor determining diversity was the quantity of winter light, which is higher on Tilia platyphyllos when compared with Quercus ilex; the former being deciduous and the latter being evergreen. Cyanolichens, mosses and liverworts show greater vitality on the northern side of tree trunks in clear-cut systems where a few trees are retained in groups to conserve diversity (Hazell and Gustafsson 1999; Hedenås, Blomberg, and Ericson 2007).\nEpiphytes can be used as food, nesting materials, or camouflage by a range of animals and invertebrates, which may relate to their prevalence during winter when many other food sources are unavailable (Sharnoff and Rosentreter 1998; Allgaier 2007). Herbivores can damage lichens and mosses, the amount of damage varying among thallus structures and growth forms, the presence or absence of secondary metabolites, and variation in herbivore preferences (Kumpula 2001; den Herder, Kytöviita, and Niemelä 2003; Gauslaa et al. 2006; Nimis and Skert 2006; Asplund and Gauslaa 2007); damage to lichen thalli can be caused by slugs via specialised radulae, and the production of saliva and mucus (Fröberg, Baur, and Baur 2006).\n\n\n\n\n\nAllgaier, C. 2007. “Active Camouflage with Lichens in a Terrestrial Snail, Napaeus (N.)

    "text": "When aspen bark is first formed it is smooth, thin and photosynthetic (Kaufert 1937). It comprises the periderm which replaces the epidermis as the protective covering and consists of three structures: 1) the cork or phellem; 2) the cork cambium, or phellogen; and 3) the phelloderm. In smooth bark these layers are thin and difficult to discern. The bark is able to stay smooth by maintaining radial and tangential cell growth in the periderm, concomitant with a ‘sloughing off’ of the older and inactive periderm cells. A white bloom of dead periderm cells forms protective layers that also varies in consistency between high and low topographies (Covington 1975).\nRough bark is formed if the integrity of the smooth bark is lost. In these areas of damage new layers of phellogen are induced which produce further phellem, which is forced outwards. The phellem is non-living and comprises inactive suberized cells forming many layers of corky protective tissue. The process of cell differentiation that may result in thickened periderm and rough bark can be complex (Lawson and Poethig 1995; Martín-Trillo and Martínez-Zapater 2002).\nA number of different factors can initiate the switch from smooth to rough bark. As a tree ages it will be subject to external stresses which result in greater amounts of damage to the smooth bark, and which then trigger the formation of rough bark. This means that rough bark is more likely to be seen in older bark, located towards the base of the tree, with smoother bark higher up the trunk. The damaged bark of Populus tremuloides was limited to aspects of the trunk exposed to storm damage (Kaufert 1937). Colder north-easterly winds and lack of sunlight may cause damage to the periderm and account for the increase in rough bark on the north and eastern aspects. Finally the propensity to form rough bark may vary according to genotype.\nAspen bark can vary quite dramatically from very smooth to very rough, with some clones appearing ‘patchy’, whilst other clones of similar age have little to no smooth bark for the first 2-3 meters from the ground (personal observation) Figure fig-bark-types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: (Left) Bark of mature aspen showing variation in smooth, photosynthetic bark, and rougher bark; (right) closer view of rough bark with deep fissuring.

    "section": "6.2 Influence of bark on epiphytes",
    "text": "6.2 Influence of bark on epiphytes\nA major morphological feature of aspen, which is likely to affect establishment of lichens, is the bark texture. This shows striking diversity among clones within single populations (Hyvärinen, Halonen, and Kauppi 1992; Sillett et al. 2000; Boudreault et al. 2008; Lamit et al. 2011). This variation in bark texture facilitates the creation of microsites with differences in, for instance, moisture levels (Sheard and Jonescu 1974; Aboal et al. 1999; Zhang 1999; Levia and Herwitz 2005).\nAssociations between epiphyte functional groups and phorophyte quality (plant surface colonised by epiphytes) have been documented before in several studies. One of the earliest (Hale 1950) described communities of foliose and crustose lichens growing on varying bark textures of a range of tree species from the Aton Forest, Connecticut, USA. The tree species surveyed were separated into rough-barked, smooth-barked and intermediate. By examining the lichen flora on these tree species and comparing differences between bark types, the observation was made that a higher proportion of foliose species were found on rough barked trees, a higher proportion of crustose species were found on smooth barked trees, with an intermingling of functional groups on those trees with a mixture of rough and smooth bark. The process of cracking and fissuring with the sloughing off of outer periderm tissue has the capacity to significantly reduce crustose species, whilst providing a niche for foliose species. Tree species with a tendency to produce rough bark during the process of growth and development were found to have a greater abundance of transitional bark, and therefore a greater mixture of species.\nWhen comparing lichen communities on smooth- and rough-barked tree species from cool temperate rainforests in two climatically similar regions of Victoria, Australia, the dominant group of lichen species found on smooth-barked trees were crustose (Morley and Gibson 2010). Conversely, epiphyte community composition on rougher-barked trees changed as the host changed, which the authors attributed to the development of fissuring and rougher bark over time. These fissures provided a habitat for lichen species that were rare on smooth bark.\nPrevious research supports the phenomenon that rougher, fissured bark provides a more suitable niche for the establishment of foliose and fruticose lichens, though this may differ for individual species. An example of the effect of bark texture on epiphytic lichens was demonstrated by Moxham (1981) and reiterated by Armstrong and Bradwell (2011). Physical variation in bark was cited as having a ‘profound influence on the growth’, with bark texture recognised as being highly influential in the growth and development of a lichen thallus: the radial growth rate (RaGR) of Xanthoria parietina (a common foliose species preferring nutrient rich substrate) increases on smooth bark as opposed to rough bark.\nPatterns of epiphyte diversity associated with the characteristic ‘diamond-shaped’ structure of bark found on older trees have been reported (Street and Street in Cosgrove and Amphlett 2001). More rugged areas appeared to favour certain fruticose Ramalina species. Smoother sections of bark were found to be more commonly populated by crustose species such as Lecidella elaeochroma and Pertusaria or Arthonia spp., with these smooth areas positively influencing growth of other lichens such as Xanthoria parietina (Hyvärinen, Halonen, and Kauppi 1992; Gustafsson and Eriksson 1995; Hemming and Lindroth 1999; Hedenås and Ericson 2000; Street and Street in Cosgrove and Amphlett 2001). The most compelling evidence demonstrating the effect of bark texture influencing epiphyte distribution has been found by Lamit et al. (2011). Replicates of P. angustifolia genotypes were obtained via cuttings from a nearby natural population and established in a common garden experiment for approximately 16 years. After sampling the cover of bark lichen Xanthomendoza galericulata, bark roughness, bole circumference and total bark condensed tannins, significant variation in lichen cover was correlated with Populus genotype. Bark roughness was found to be under significant genetic variation and the genetically based trait that most influenced lichen cover."

    "section": "6.3 Secondary metabolites of aspen",
    "text": "6.3 Secondary metabolites of aspen\nLike most members of the Salicaceae, aspen produces a range of secondary metabolites, which are substances produced and used by plants for defence against herbivory, high levels of UV radiation, and pathogenic attack (Bennett and Wallsgrove 1994; Grégoire et al. 1997; Ockels et al. 2007). One particular class of metabolites are polyphenols. These compounds are synthesized from the amino acid phenylalanine along the shikimate-phenylpropanoid pathway, and undergo many enzymatic changes to produce phenolic glycosides, flavonoid glycosides, and condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins) (Tsai et al. 2006). Phenolic and flavonoid glycosides are a combination of a sugar attached to non-carbohydrate moiety (the glycoside, or glycone) and a simple phenol ring (in the case of phenolic glycosides) or one of many types of flavonoid (in the case of flavonoid glycosides) (Harborne 1964; Hopkinson 1969) (Figure fig-phenols).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: (Left) A simple phenol with hydroxyl (OH) bond, and (right) a common phenolic glycoside, salicin, showing the phenol ring at the bottom of the structure. Chemspider, 2011.\n\n\nThese latter components are known formally as the aglycone. Some phenolic glycosides (e.g. salicin and salicortin) occur widely throughout many Populus species (Tsai et al. 2006). In recent years, flavonoids in particular have gained a great deal of publicity for their health benefits to humans, particularly as anti-carcinogens and their de-toxifying properties (Ververidis et al. 2007). Large quantities of these compounds are found ubiquitously in plant organs, including bark of Populus species (Pearl and Darling 1968; Richard L. Lindroth and Hwang 1996). Production of phenolics has significant costs to plant growth, especially for genotypes producing high quantities of compounds (Osier and Lindroth 2001, 2004, 2006). Variation in phenolic quantity is largely under genetic control, but varies temporally and spatially according to genotype and environment (R. L. Lindroth, Hsia, and Scriber 1987; Richard L. Lindroth and Hwang 1996; Hemming and Lindroth 1999; Osier and Lindroth 2001; R. L. Lindroth et al. 2002; Whitham et al. 2003; Whitham et al. 2005; Donaldson et al. 2006; Rehill et al. 2006; Donaldson and Lindroth 2007)."

    "text": "6.4 Effects of bark chemicals on lichens\nThe effects of bark chemicals on epiphytes growing on the bark have not been thoroughly investigated. However, there is evidence of phenolics possessing fungistatic or fungitoxic properties in vitro (Hopkinson 1969; Gupta et al. 1971; Anaya et al. 1999; Evensen et al. 2000; Wang et al. 2010; Ćirić et al. 2011). Evidence was found by Koopmann (2005) linking bark phenolic compounds isolated from Populus and patterns in lichen diversity, and inhibitory allelopathic effects of lichens on co-occurring cryptogams, including other lichen species mediating differences in the lichen communities associated with aspen via defense reactions initiated after colonization of the bark, as with fungi (Bennett and Wallsgrove 1994). It is therefore of special interest to determine whether epiphyte communities on aspen vary among clones, and whether this variation in epiphyte communities can be accounted for by differences in physical and chemical properties of the trees.\n\n\n\n\n\nAboal, J R, D Morales, M Hernández, and M S Jiménez. 1999. “The Measurement and Modelling of the Variation of Stemflow in a Laurel Forest in Tenerife, Canary Islands.” Journal of Hydrology 221 (3-4): 161–75. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-1694(99)00086-4.\n\n\nAnaya, A L, R Mata, F Rivero-Cruz, B E Hernandez-Bautista, D Chavez-Velasco, and A Gomez-Pompa. 1999. “Allelopathic Potential of Metopium Brownei.” Journal of Chemical Ecology 25 (1): 141–56.\n\n\nArmstrong, R A, and T Bradwell. 2011. “Growth of Foliose Lichens: A Review.” Symbiosis (Philadelphia, Pa.) 53 (1): 1–16. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13199-011-0108-4.\n\n\nBennett, R N, and R M Wallsgrove. 1994. “Secondary Metabolites in Plant Defence Mechanisms.” New Phytologist 127 (4): 617–33. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb02968.x.\n\n\nBoudreault, C, D S Coxson, E Vincent, Y Bergeron, and J Marsh. 2008. “Variation in Epiphytic Lichen and Bryophyte Composition and Diversity Along a Gradient of Productivity in Populus Tremuloides Stands of Northeastern British Columbia, Canada.” Ecoscience 15 (1): 101–12. https://doi.org/10.2980/1195-6860(2008)15[101:VIELAB]2.0.CO;2.\n\n\nĆirić, A, A Karioti, J Glamočlija, M D Soković, and H Skaltsa. 2011. “Antimicrobial Activity of Secondary Metabolites Isolated from Centaurea Spruneri Boiss.& Heldr.” Journal of The Serbian Chemical Society 76: 27–34.\n\n\nCosgrove, P, and A Amphlett, eds. 2001.

    "section": "7.1 Sampling in natural populations",
    "text": "7.1 Sampling in natural populations\nThis approach has the advantage of making measurements under realistic ecological conditions, assessing whether genetic effects are sufficiently important, and whether they have a significant influence on dependent community composition in nature (Tack et al. 2010). It is anticipated that sampling natural populations will provide a realistic representation of how the variation in measured traits may influence epiphyte communities in the wild. Significant results obtained from an experimental trial may not be reproducible in a wild system. However it is important to acknowledge that this approach is subject to a number of limitations that restrict the interpretation of the results obtained from the study. A major limitation is sourcing a sufficient quantity of wild clones, within close proximity to one another, and containing enough ramets to be statistically meaningful. A second limitation is that environmental variation within a given site may confound genetic variation between clones; environmental causes of differences in dependent communities may be difficult to disentangle. To some extent this difficulty can be overcome if clones are intermingled, but the problem remains.\nA third limitation of utilising observations in natural populations is that the study will necessarily be restricted to a single site. The genotypes will only be observed under a single set of environmental conditions. This means that it is not possible to draw more general conclusions about the wider importance of any effects of genotypic variation within the structural species on the community composition of dependent species. A fourth problem associated with studies of natural populations is that they only allow determination of effects of genetic variation that exist within the single study population of the dependent species. This genetic variation may be insufficient to have an influence on epiphyte community composition. However genetic variation found between populations may be much larger and more important in determining dependent community composition, as has been found for Eucalyptus globulus in south-eastern Australia (Barbour, O’Reilly-Wapstra, et al. 2009; Barbour, Forster, et al. 2009).\nA fifth problem with using wild populations is that the different ramets of the same clone may be connected below ground, because of their origin from suckers, and therefore represent non-independent units. It is currently unknown how interconnected the ramets are within their respective clones. However it is believed that independence of ramets from parent trees is likely to occur after 8 years. The aspen clones in the population at Invertromie are 50-80 years old and therefore are likely to have been living on rootstocks independent of the parent ramet for several decades (Section 4). The Highland Aspen Group have also been cutting sections of root away from the Invertromie clones used in this study, further reducing any existing connections between the ramets measured. Taking these facts into consideration the ramets used in chapters 2 and 3 are likely to be largely unconnected, and independent of one another, though the possibility remains that some ramets may be dependent on the same rootstock. For the purposes of the statistical analysis of variation within and among clones, ramets of the same clone will be treated as independent samples of that clone. However it is acknowledged that there is no way to currently establish the degree of connectedness between ramets. If ramets are connected then they will be pseudoreplicates, and the significance of any differences between clones in the statistical analyses will be overestimated.\nThe final problem with utilising studies from natural populations is that differences in age will exist among the ramets that are compared. Bark characteristics are known to change with tree age. Therefore age may be a confounding factor in the analysis."

    "section": "7.2 Sampling on experimental populations",
    "text": "7.2 Sampling on experimental populations\nIn order to overcome the limitations of observations made in natural populations, a more controlled experimental approach may be adopted. Here replicate cuttings of genotypes of the foundation species are taken and planted in trial sites in a randomised block design. The main advantage of this method is that any differences in the epiphyte communities that establish on these different genotypes are due to genetic differences between the clones, not to differences in the environment occupied by the genotypes. A second advantage of this design is that genotypes of the foundation species can be replicated over a number of sites. This allows us to test whether any genetic effects on community composition of dependent species are reproducible or specific to a particular set of environmental conditions. A third advantage of this design is that it allows cuttings to be taken from a range of different populations of the foundation species to ensure that a broad range of genetic differences within the foundation species are tested. The results are therefore not constrained by the limited amount of genetic variation present within the foundation species at a single site. Finally if the experiments are set up at the same time, age of the ramets does not become a confounding factor affecting epiphyte community composition. However there are some drawbacks to employing this method. Clonal trials using multiple genotypes from diverse areas fail to thoroughly deal with genetic effects at varying spatial scales. Increasing the distance at which the effects of genetic variation in foundation species are studied, from common garden, to local, site and landscape level, can show a significant decrease in host genetic effects on associated communities (Maddox and Cappuccino 1986, 1986; Tack et al. 2010). In certain cases, genetic effects on community structure can be reduced by environmental variation. Another problem is that removing a genotype associated with a particular area, and using it in a clonal trial in a location where it would not normally grow may attract a suite of dependent organisms not usually associated with that genotype.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarbour, R C, L G Forster, S C Baker, D A Steane, and B M Potts. 2009. “Biodiversity Consequences of Genetic Variation in Bark Characteristics Within a Foundation Tree Species.” Conservation Biology 23 (5): 1146–55. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01247.x.\n\n\nBarbour, R C, J M O’Reilly-Wapstra, D W De Little, G J Jordan, D A Steane, J R Humphreys, J K Bailey, T G Whitham, and B M Potts. 2009. “A Geographic Mosaic of Genetic Variation Within a Foundation Tree Species and Its Community-Level Consequences.” Ecology 90 (7): 1762–72. https://doi.org/10.1890/08-0951.1.\n\n\nMaddox, G D, and N Cappuccino. 1986. “Genetic Determination of Plant Susceptibility to an Herbivorous Insect Depends on Environmental Context.” Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution 40 (4): 863–66. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1986.tb00547.x.\n\n\nTack, A J M, O Ovaskainen, P Pulkkinen, and T Roslin. 2010. “Spatial Location Dominates over Host Plant Genotype in Structuring an Herbivore Community.” Ecology 91 (9): 2660–72. https://doi.org/10.1890/09-1027.1."

    "text": "Communities are assemblages of different organisms, some of which provide a foundation, or habitat, for other (dependent) species that make up the rest of the community. Genetic variability within the foundation species has the potential to influence the expression of physical traits within that species, and in turn influence the dependent species sensitive to these traits. Community genetics is the area of research that investigates how genetic differences in one species, usually a foundation species, affects communities of dependent species.\nThe study of community genetics can be undertaken in two situations, which were explored in a special issue of Ecology. The first is where novel crops are introduced and have immediate impact on the local communities (Neuhauser et al. 2003); the second is in a natural, longer-established ecosystem with greater equilibrium and genetic stability, e.g. woodlands and permanent grasslands (Whitham et al. 2003). In the latter situation a decision needs to be made on which species to include in such studies. We have first to recognize the foundation species, then to define the dependent species. When this has been done we can then identify traits that are likely to be important in their interaction (Chase and Knight 2003).\nIn woodland systems chief structural components are the trees. These interact with a wide variety of different dependent communities, such as arthropods, endophytes, epiphytes and micro-organisms. A priori we might expect that genetic variation in trees will have effects on these communities; greater than average genetic variation is found within trees is in hybrid zones.\nHybrid zones occur naturally where two or more species overlap within their native range (Anderson and Stebbins 1954; Ellstrand, Whitkus, and Rieseberg 1996; Milne et al. 2010), and are particularly common in trees e.g. Quercus, Picea, Ulmus, and Populus. Trees in hybrid zones segregate for large genetic differences found between species. For instance, marked differences between clones of P. tremula and P. tremuloides and their hybrids grown in common garden experiments were observed when examining nutrient content in wood (Rytter and Stener 2003), growth and phenological traits (Yu, Tigerstedt, and Haapanen 2001), and concentrations of secondary compounds in leaves (B. Rehill et al. 2005; B. J. Rehill et al. 2006). There is now a lot of evidence that shows genetically determined differences in hybrid zones of Populus (P. angustifolia and P. fremontii) that affect a wide variety of dependent communities (Whitham et al. 1999). Similar results have come from studies of related hybrid systems e.g., Eucalytpus and Quercus (Whitham et al. 2006).\nThe usefulness of hybrid studies to understand the influence of genetics on physical traits and potential (or realized) community structure is well established. However confining studies to the use of hybrid complexes may introduce confounding factors. Interspecific variation is generally greater than intraspecific variation; therefore the recombination of genetic material from two sexually compatible species can form hybrid complexes that manifest a broader range of physical traits capable of influencing communities than the natural range of variation seen within a species. Moreover hybridization can generate novel phenotypes lying outside the range of the parent species. Such hybrids may show lower herbivore resistance and can act as ‘sinks’ for herbivorous insects even if the parental species are resistant to such attack (Whitham 1989; Floate, Kearsley, and Whitham 1993). Finally it should be noted that hybrid zones represent only a small fraction of tree populations.\nGiven these limitations it is important to determine if the community effects described in hybrid systems can be demonstrated within a single species. Preliminary evidence from a range of systems suggests that genetic variation within a species can often be sufficient to affect community structure of dependent organisms (Johnson and Agrawal 2005; Bangert et al. 2005, 2006; Barbour, O’Reilly-Wapstra, et al. 2009; Tack et al. 2010)."

    "text": "9.2 Variation within and between populations\nGenetic variation within a species can come from two sources: between populations and within populations. Genetic differences between populations of a species have been shown to significantly influence arthropod fauna, taking into consideration a range of spatial scales (Johnson and Agrawal 2005; Bangert et al. 2006; Tack et al. 2010). In addition recent research has shown that variation within a foundational species, within a population, has an effect on communities of dependent organisms (Dickson and Whitham 1996; Wimp et al. 2007; Barbour, O’Reilly-Wapstra, et al. 2009; Kanaga 2009). This suggests that genetic diversity within populations of foundation species particularly play an important role in shaping assemblages of associated species; even small differences between genotypes may be sufficient to affect changes. If these traits are heritable and stable across a range of environmental conditions it would be logical to conclude that each genotype of a foundation species is capable of formulating its own distinct community within a site. Extrapolated to the landscape and ecosystem levels, this could have drastic implications for ecosystem and global biodiversity."

    "text": "9.3 Effects of foundation species on dependent communities\nGiven the potential importance of these effects it is imperative to broaden our range of studies of the effects of foundation species genotype on dependent species. To do this a model system is needed in which there is an intimate interaction between a foundation species and a dependent community. In the past interactions between trees and arthropods, particularly leaf herbivores, have been chosen (Osier and Lindroth 2001, 2004, 2006; Bailey et al. 2005; Shuster et al. 2006; Bangert and Whitham 2007; Tack et al. 2010). However there are other groups that form very important communities on trees that have been overlooked, such as epiphytic lichens (Gustafsson and Eriksson 1995; Uliczka and Angelstam 1999; Hedenås and Ericson 2000; Juriado, Paal, and Liira 2003). These interact directly with trees. Trees provide microsites within which epiphytes establish and grow (Hill and Barkman 1958; Kantvilas and Jarman 2004; Fritz and Heilmann-Clausen 2010). There is also evidence many epiphytes, particularly lichens, penetrate the surface of the tree and interact with chemicals and bark tissues (Ascaso, González, and Vicente 1980; Ascaso, Orus, and Estévez 1983; Ascaso and Rapsch 1985; Inoue, Noguchi, and Kubo 1987; M. Legaz et al. 1988; Bouaid and Vicente 1998; M. E. Legaz, Monso, and Vicente 2004). Thus there is the potential for genetic variation affecting bark morphology and bark chemistry of trees to influence the communities of epiphytes that colonize them.\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether genetically determined differences in bark morphology and bark chemicals in a foundation tree species influence the composition of its epiphytic lichen community."

    "section": "9.4 Aspen as a foundation species",
    "text": "9.4 Aspen as a foundation species\nOne such tree species is aspen (Populus tremula L.). In many localities aspen is clonal, reproducing from root suckers rather than seed. This leads to the availability of replicate stems within a clone, with the same genotype. Therefore it is possible to assess whether there are significant differences between clones for microsite characters of bark and the chemical composition of bark. Aspen is also amenable to study because of the rich and diverse epiphyte flora (Gustafsson and Eriksson 1995; Jüriado et al. 2009), associated with the high pH of the bark (Hedenås and Ericson 2000; Street and Street in Cosgrove and Amphlett 2001; Ellis and Coppins 2007; Jüriado et al. 2009).\nA major character of bark likely to affect establishment of lichens on aspen is variation in bark texture (Hyvärinen, Halonen, and Kauppi 1992; Sillett et al. 2000; Boudreault et al. 2008; Lamit et al. 2011). This variation facilitates the creation of microsites with differences in moisture levels (Sheard and Jonescu 1974; Aboal et al. 1999; Zhang 1999; Levia and Herwitz 2005). It is important to establish, in the first instance, whether genetic differences between clones in natural situations are manifested in % smooth bark.\nA major chemical family found in bark, particularly knotwood, is the polyphenols (Pietarinen et al. 2006; Neacsu et al. 2007), which include condensed tannins and phenolic glycosides exhibiting strong defences against invasion by pathogens, wood-boring insects and UV radiation (Bennett and Wallsgrove 1994; Lindroth and Hwang 1996; Lieutier et al. in Grégoire et al. 1997; Ockels et al. 2007). Limited studies have demonstrated that these latter compounds significantly affect lichen growth (Koopmann 2005). Therefore in the second instance it is necessary to determine whether there are clonal differences in phenolic chemistry of bark tissue with which the epiphytic lichens interact. Of course it is likely that bark morphology and chemistry may be affected by other factors such as age of tree, aspect and height (Levia and Wubbena 2006; Hamilton et al. 2007; Barbour, Forster, et al. 2009). To demonstrate that genetics play a primary role in determining bark morphology and chemical composition, it is important to investigate the effects of aspect and height on % smooth bark and chemistry.\nTherefore, to achieve these goals, a natural stand of a minimum of five aspen clones growing in close proximity is required. Using genetic markers and phenology the ramets can be classified into genets. Then individual ramets of the same age can be sampled and scored for % smooth bark and secondary chemical composition; sampling must carried out at different heights and different aspects to determine their effects.\nQuestions asked are:\n\nAre there significant differences between clones in the characters measured?\nHow much of the variation is accounted for by variation between clones?\nIs any of the residual variation (within clones) accounted for by either height or aspect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAboal, J R, D Morales, M Hernández, and M S Jiménez. 1999. “The Measurement and Modelling of the Variation of Stemflow in a Laurel Forest in Tenerife, Canary Islands.” Journal of Hydrology 221 (3-4): 161–75. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-1694(99)00086-4.\n\n\nAnderson, E, and G L Stebbins. 1954. “Hybridization as an Evolutionary Stimulus.” Evolution 8 (4): 378–88. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1954.tb01504.x.\n\n\nAscaso, C, C González, and C Vicente. 1980. “Epiphytic Evernia Prunastri Ultrastructural Facts (L.)
